<h3 class="h3">Using CSS Animations</h3>
<p>CSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another. Animations consist of two components, a style describing the CSS animation and a set of keyframes that indicate the start and end states of the animation's style, as well as possible intermediate waypoints.</p>

<p>There are three key advantages to CSS animations over traditional script-driven animation techniques:</p>

<ol>
<li>They're easy to use for simple animations; you can create them without even having to know JavaScript.</li>
<li>The animations run well, even under moderate system load. Simple animations can often perform poorly in JavaScript (unless they're well made). The rendering engine can use frame-skipping and other techniques to keep the performance as smooth as possible.</li>
<li>Letting the browser control the animation sequence lets the browser optimize performance and efficiency by, for example, reducing the update frequency of animations running in tabs that aren't currently visible.</li>
</ol>
